  <h1 section-title>Rubin Observatory and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)</h1>
  <p>
    The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a state-of-the-art astronomical facility designed to conduct the Legacy Survey of
    Space and Time (LSST), a ten-year survey that will capture an unprecedented view of the dynamic night sky. Equipped
    with an 8.4-meter telescope and the world’s largest digital camera, LSST will generate approximately 20 terabytes of
    data each night. This massive dataset will enable researchers to study transient phenomena, track near-Earth
    objects, probe dark matter and dark energy, and explore the evolving structure of the universe.
  </p>
  <p>
    LSST will help scientists answer some of the biggest questions about our universe. By tracking asteroids and comets,
    it will improve our ability to detect objects that might come close to Earth. By observing how galaxies change over
    time, LSST will help us understand the mysterious forces shaping the cosmos, such as dark energy. The survey will
    also allow astronomers to see supernova explosions and other dramatic cosmic events as they happen, providing new
    insights into the life cycles of stars and the nature of space itself.
