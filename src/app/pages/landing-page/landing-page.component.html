  <p>
    The <strong>Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)</strong> is a groundbreaking astronomical survey that will
    capture an unprecedented view of the universe. Using the state-of-the-art <strong>Vera C. Rubin Observatory</strong>,
    LSST will collect vast amounts of data — billions of celestial objects imaged over a decade — unlocking the
    mysteries of dark matter, dark energy, and the dynamic night sky. To help researchers process this enormous data
    set, the <strong>Pitt-Google Broker</strong>, developed as a collaboration between Google and the University of
    Pittsburgh, provides powerful tools for filtering, classifying, and analyzing LSST alerts in real time. Leveraging
    <strong>Google Cloud</strong> and machine learning, the Pitt-Google broker enables astronomers to rapidly identify
    and follow up on transient events such as supernovae, variable stars, and asteroids.
